# VRecords System Specification

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** VRecords
**Purpose:** VRecords is a financial record‑keeping system designed for a small group of people who save money together, lend to one another at agreed interest rates, and share accumulated savings and interest at the end of a defined period.

The system focuses on transparency, accountability, and simplicity, ensuring that all financial activities within the group are clearly tracked and reported.

## 2. System Objectives

* Track member savings and loans accurately
* Manage loan issuance, repayments, and interest
* Represent savings in the form of shares
* Calculate fair distribution of funds at the end of a cycle
* Generate clear financial reports for members

---

## 3. Users and Roles

### 3.1 Chairperson

**Responsibilities:**

* Add members to the group
* Remove members from the group
* Oversee overall group composition

### 3.2 Treasurer

**Responsibilities:**

* Record savings contributions
* Track loans issued to members
* Record loan repayments
* Update loan status (active / cleared)
* Generate financial reports (PDF format)

### 3.3 Members

## 4. Core System Features

### 4.1 Loan Tracking

* Record loan amount, borrower, interest rate, and repayment period
* Track repayments made by members
* Automatically update loan status based on repayments

### 4.2 Savings Tracking (Shares‑Based)

* Savings are represented as **shares**
* Each share has a fixed monetary value
* Member savings are calculated by the number of shares owned

**Example:**
If one share costs 300 and a member contributes 900, the member owns 3 shares.

### 4.3 Interest Calculation

* Interest is earned from loans issued to members
* Total interest earned belongs to the group
* Interest is distributed proportionally based on shares

### 4.4 Shares Distribution Formula

At the end of a savings cycle, each member receives:

```
(Member Shares / Total Group Shares) × (Total Savings + Total Interest)
```

This ensures fair and transparent distribution.

### 4.5 Reporting

* Generate PDF reports for individual members
* Reports include:

  * Savings (shares owned)
  * Loans taken and repayments made
  * Interest earned
  * Final payout projection
